History of updates to Authen::SASL::Cyrus

0.04
Added a method "securesocket" that takes a file handle and returns a
new file handle that is tied to the Security subclass added in 0.03. 
In this way, a client program can take the object returned from
client_new() and call the securesocket() method on it, passing in the
client's file handle, without ever having to know about the Security
subclass.  Also added a "tiehandle" method which will take the same
file handle as "securesocket", and tie it directly to the Security
subclass. The difference being "securesocket" returns a new file handle,
and "tiehandle" ties the handle passed in.

0.03  
Added encryption layer. Cyrus.xs now has encode() and decode()
methods. Added a "Security" subclass that can be used to tie a
filehandle to perform encryption on write() and decryption on read().
The new() method ties a passed in glob to the class.

0.02
Encryption layer not ready yet, so changed the "secflag" param in the
call to sasl_client_new() from 1 to 0.  Otherwise, the server will
start expecting encrypted requests and sending encrypted responses
after the authentication, and the client cannot encrypt/decrypt.
