History of updates to Authen::SASL::Cyrus


0.03  
Added encryption layer. Cyrus.xs now has encode() and decode()
methods. Added a "Security" subclass that can be used to tie a
filehandle to perform encryption on write() and decryption on read().
The new() method ties a passed in glob to the class.

0.02
Encryption layer not ready yet, so changed the "secflag" param in the
call to sasl_client_new() from 1 to 0.  Otherwise, the server will
start expecting encrypted requests and sending encrypted responses
after the authentication, and the client cannot encrypt/decrypt.

0.01
Initial release
